Upon RouteMaestro’s request, Customer will provide proof of withholding tax remittance to the applicable tax authority. Both parties agree to apply any applicable tax treaty and provide the necessary documentation for application of such treaty, where applicable, to reduce the withholding tax. With respect to Taxes charged on or applicable to the purchase or sale of Travel Services, RouteMaestro shall reflect such Taxes in invoices and/or in the reporting available to Customer on the RouteMaestro Site, and Customer shall be responsible for the payment of all such Taxes.

                9.1. Confidentiality Obligations. During the Term of the Agreement, neither party shall make the other’s Confidential Information available to any third party or use the other’s Confidential Information for any purposes other than exercising its rights and performing its obligations under the Agreement. Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information except to such party’s advisors, accountants, attorneys, investors (and prospective investors), and prospective acquirers that have a reasonable need to know such information, provided that any such third parties shall, before they may access such information, either (a) execute a binding agreement to keep such information confidential or (b) be subject to a professional obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the other’s Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of the Agreement, but in no event will either party use less effort to protect the Confidential Information of the other party than it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like importance. Each party will ensure that any agents or subcontractors that are permitted to access any of the other’s Confidential Information are legally bound to comply with the obligations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed as required by any governmental agency, provided that before disclosing such information the receiving party must provide (to the extent permitted by applicable law) the disclosing party with sufficient advance notice of the agency’s request for the information to provide the disclosing party an opportunity to exercise any rights it may have to challenge or limit the agency’s authority to receive such Confidential Information.
</br>9.2. Post-Termination Obligations. The receiving party’s obligations to guard the disclosing party’s Confidential Information will survive for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination of the Agreement, except that personal information within a party’s reasonable control shall be kept confidential in perpetuity until such personal information is returned or deleted. Personal information may be deleted through obfuscation. The receiving party may retain an archival copy of the Confidential Information to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or archival policies, provided that such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to all confidentiality obligations under the Agreement.
</br>9.3. Security Obligations. RouteMaestro shall (i) maintain appropriate information security practices for RouteMaestro’s systems used to provide Services, including reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, any Customer Data (a “Security Incident”), and (ii) comply with all privacy and data security laws and regulations applicable to RouteMaestro. RouteMaestro shall promptly notify Customer of any confirmed Security Incident that has impacted Customer Data, investigate, and remediate any such Security Incident. RouteMaestro shall have no responsibility to pay Breach Costs related to a Security Incident to the extent such costs are due to the negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by Customer or its Users.

            <p class="text-black" style="font-size: 16px;">
                11.1. Term. The term of the Agreement shall be as set forth in the applicable Service Order (“Term”). The Agreement shall commence on the date set forth in the Service Order (or, if no Service Order is in place, then on the date that RouteMaestro notifies Customer that it has approved Customer to begin using the Services) and shall continue until it expires or is earlier terminated as provided in the Agreement. Commencement of the Services shall be determined by the Parties and included in the applicable Service Order. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Service Order, the Term shall automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Term unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the expiring Term. RouteMaestro reserves the right to increase any Fees upon automatic renewal, provided the increase is not more than five percent (5%) per annum.
            </br>  11.2. Termination for Cause. If either party commits a material breach of its obligations in the Agreement or any Service Order (including payment obligations), the non-defaulting party may give written notice to the defaulting party specifying the nature of the default, and if such default is not remedied, or substantial efforts are not made to remedy such default, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice, then the non-defaulting party shall have the right to immediately terminate the Agreement or the Service Order by written notice. If the breach relates solely to one Service Order or Service, then only that Service Order or Service may be terminated in accordance with the terms herein and the other Service Orders and the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that Customer terminates in accordance with the Agreement, Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of unused, prepaid Fees as of the date of termination.
              </br>  11.3. Termination for Insolvency. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, either party may terminate the Agreement immediately by providing written notice to the other party in the event the other party becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, ceases to do business, or if any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, liquidation proceeding, or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or other law for the relief of debtors is instituted by or against such party.
              </br>  11.4. Rights and Obligations Upon Expiration or Termination. In no event shall any termination or expiration relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any undisputed Fees or Charges payable to RouteMaestro for the period prior to the effective date of termination or expiration. Provided RouteMaestro is not terminating for cause under Section 12.2 and upon Customer’s request, RouteMaestro will reasonably cooperate with Customer in a wind-down of Services prior to termination of a Service or of the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for downloading any Customer Data and/or reporting available within the Services prior to the date of expiration or termination. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, (i) Customer’s and Users’ right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate, (ii) Customer and its Users shall immediately cease all use of the Services, (iii) RouteMaestro shall cease use of the Customer Marks within a reasonable time, and (iv) each party shall delete or return, and make no further use of, any Confidential Information, materials, or other items (and all copies thereof) belonging to the other party, in accordance with Section 10.

RouteMaestro shall indemnify Customer, its officers, directors and employees, from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, associated with any third party’s claim that (i) the Services or Customer’s authorized use of Services infringes or misappropriate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (ii) arises out of RouteMaestro’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or (iii) arises out of RouteMaestro’s breach of its agreements with a PSP, if applicable. RouteMaestro’s obligations under this Section 13.2 are contingent upon (a) Customer providing RouteMaestro with prompt written notice of such claim; (b) Customer providing reasonable cooperation to RouteMaestro, at RouteMaestro’s expense, in the defense and settlement of such claim; and (c) with respect to a claim described in Section 13.2(i) above, RouteMaestro having sole authority to defend or settle such claim. RouteMaestro shall have no liability under this Section 13.2 to the extent that any claims described herein are based on use of the Services in a manner that violates: (1) the Agreement; or (2) instructions provided to Customer by RouteMaestro, so long as they are reasonable and consistent with the terms of the Agreement.
                </br> 12.3 Infringement Claim Remedies. With respect to claims described in subsection 13.2(i), in the event that RouteMaestro’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in RouteMaestro’s reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, RouteMaestro may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate the Agreement without liability to Customer and provide a pro rata refund of any Fees prepaid and unused upon such termination. Sections 13.2 and 13.3 state the entire obligation of RouteMaestro and its licensors with respect to any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of third-party Intellectual Property Rights by the Services.

                13.2 Limitation of Liability.
